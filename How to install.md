To setup the blog, you need to connect two folders to each other.   On the left, is the actual data/posts of the blog, which are stored on Google Drive.   On the right is the vault which you will open with Obsidian.  Follow the directions below:

------------------------------------------------------------
Google Drive/                           obsidian-blog/     
    your-blog-data/          <------>       blog-vault/ 
     
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
First, select this with the             Second, open this as
link-to-google-drive script             a vault in Obsidian

2. Clone the `obsidian-blog` git repo from GitHub at https://github.com/amccaugh/obsidian-blog

3. Open up the linking script in the repo:

     `Manage vaults` â†’ `Open folder as vault`
   - Navigate to:  
     `obsidian-blog/blog-vault/` (from the repo you cloned)
   - Select it to open as your blog vault.
